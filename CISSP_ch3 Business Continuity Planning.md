# Business Continuity Planning

**Domain 1.0: Security and Risk Management**

**Domain 7.0: Security Operations**

## Planning for Business Continuity

**Business continuity planning (BCP)** involves assessing the risks to organizational processes and creating policies, plans, and procedures to minimize the impact those risks might have on the organization if they were to occur. BCP is used to maintain the continuous operation of a business in the event of an emergency. The goal of BCP planners is to implement a combination of policies, procedures, and processes such that a potentially disruptive event has as little impact on the business as possible.

As long as the continuity of the organization’s ability to perform its mission-critical work tasks is maintained, BCP can be used to manage and restore the environment.

##### Business Continuity Planning vs. Disaster Recovery Planning

Both activities help prepare an organization for a disaster. They intend to keep operations running continuously, when possible, and recover functions as quickly as possible if a disruption occurs. 

The perspective difference is that

-  **business continuity activities** are typically strategically focused at a high level and center themselves on business processes and operations. 
- **Disaster recovery plans** tend to be more tactical and describe technical activities such as recovery sites, backups, and fault tolerance.

The **overall goal of BCP** is to provide a quick, calm, and efficient response in the event of an emergency and to enhance a company’s ability to recover from a disruptive event promptly.

The BCP process has **four main steps:**

1. Project scope and planning
2. Business impact analysis
3. Continuity planning
4. Approval and implementation

### Step 1. Project Scope and Planning

Organizations should approach the planning process with several goals in mind:

- Perform a structured review of the business’s organization from a crisis planning point of view.
- Create a BCP team with the approval of senior management.
- Assess the resources available to participate in business continuity activities.
- Analyze the legal and regulatory landscape that governs an organization’s response to a catastrophic event.

The purpose of this phase is to ensure that the organization dedicates sufficient time and attention to both developing the project scope and plan and then documenting those activities for future reference.
